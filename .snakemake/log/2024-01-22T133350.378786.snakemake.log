    * Param outdir is a prefix of input or output file but hardcoded:
      If this is meant to represent a file path prefix, it will fail when running workflow in environments
      without a shared filesystem. Instead, provide a function that infers the appropriate prefix from the
      input or output file, e.g.: lambda w, input: os.path.splitext(input[0])[0]

    * Shell command directly uses variable print from outside of the rule:
      It is recommended to pass all files as input and output, and non-file parameters via the params
